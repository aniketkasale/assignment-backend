## Backend

This is a backend project built with Node.js, which provides two API endpoints for fetching data. The API endpoints are:

### Get Tasks

To fetch tasks data, make a GET request to `/tasks`. The response will contain a JSON object of tasks data.

### Get Users

To fetch users data, make a GET request to `/users`. The response will contain a JSON object of users data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running the server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
2. The server will listen on port `5001` by default. You can access the API endpoints using the base URL `http://localhost:5001`.
